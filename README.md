	This software was made for my Winter Co-op 2020 term working for the Darlington Nuclear Power plant<https://www.opg.com/strengthening-the-economy/our-projects/darlington-refurbishment/project-team/>. This software is written in python, its function are parsing exiting (private) .docx documents [Properties of Canatom Group] into a cleanly templated .xml file(Excel). This code IS hard coded to a specific degree and not dynamic. I am offer a simple template and approach to syncing .docx & .xml creation.
